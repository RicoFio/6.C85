    <h2>Proposition: Northern America is A Main Contributor of Climate Change</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>In <strong>Favor</strong> of the Proposition</h3>

            <figcaption>
                <strong>Left:</strong> Northern America and Europe are the main contributors, per-capita, of GHG
                equivalent CO2 emissions in metric tons. Over the past decade, Asia has been catching up to both
                Europe and Northern America. The dotted line represents the cumulative global per-capita emission.
                <strong>Right:</strong> Northern America has a highly elevated per-capita
                average surface temperature increase compared to the rest of the world. It has been increasing,
				and this trend will persist with the expansion of sealed surfaces and the continuation of urbanization
				and deforestation. The green dotted line represents the global mean per-capita
				average surface temperature increase.

        <p>
            Design Decisions and Rationale:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                In the left plot, which represents the per-capita GHG emissions in terms of CO2 equivalent metric
				tons, we set Asia as a delimiter of what
                can be considered "good" emissions through color-coding (targeting a Western audience). This is
                purposeful and gives the reader the impression that any emission level above this developing
                BRIC countries' are bad and are main contributors to this factor of climate change.
                A true delimitation does not exist, since the global GHG emissions are significantly higher than what
                would be naturally emitted through biochemical processes. The strategically placed legend gives a sense
                of just how high the global per-capita GHG emissions are while contemporarily
                warping the space between Europe, Northern America, and the worldwide emissions. Finally, we note
                that in an unbiased visualization, we would have used the global mean instead of the cumulative
                per-capita emissions (blue dotted line). However, in this case, the cumulative global emissions give
				a nice upper-bound which is far away from other values, giving us some less convoluted visuals.
				Finally, note the alarmingly red-colored area, which is meant to trigger a more affective reaction in
                the viewer to gain a qualifying view on the contributors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Surface temperatures per capita is not a widely considered factor. Due to land
                properties and albedo, continents can have widely differing surface temperatures. However, the average
                change in temperatures represents the deviation from historical values, and while considering them in
                terms of per-capita is not a standard measure, it can inform us how anthropogenic changes to land
                and vegetation, such as parking, urbanization, industry, and deforestation, are impacting
                heat distributions. Similar to the plot below, I have removed comparability
                by excluding other continents. Coloring then indicates how temperature increases in Northern America are
				much more alarming than those seen on average. The choice of coloring the area below the dotted green line is
				purposeful and again indicates the viewer a "healthy" baseline, which, however, is arbitrarily set by me.
            </li>
            <li>
                In conjunction, these visualizations picture a negative image of Northern America, providing factual
                blame on the continent's contribution to global climate change through both GHG emissions and
                increases in average surface temperatures. Thus, using these visualizations, the audience can easily
				take a stand in favor of the proposition, i.e., argue that Northern America <strong>is indeed</strong>
				one of the main contributors to climate change.

        <h3><strong>Opposed</strong> to the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="./us_wins.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                <strong>Left:</strong> Asia is globally, in absolute numbers, the main contributor of GHG
                equivalent CO2 emissions in metric tons. Furthermore, its emissions have been increasing
                significantly over the past two decades. The dotted line represents the cumulative global GHG emission
                across all continents.
                <strong>Right:</strong> Northern America has a lower-than-average surface temperature increase
                compared to the rest of the world. The green dotted line represents the global mean of average
                surface temperature increases.

            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Design Decisions and Rationale:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The design elements used in these two plots are similar but inverted to the above in order to
				counter the proposition. Instead of using per-capita normalization, I made use of absolute values.
				As one of the smaller continents, Northern America has a smaller impact on the global GHG emission
				balance. However, it
				actually contributes equally to the global average surface temperature increase which would be evident
				if the other continents would be displayed, and if we would remove the smoothing applied on the values
				of Northern America as explained below.
				.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the left plot, we see the global CO2 equivalence of GHG emissions in metric tons, indicating that
                Asia is the main contributor to worldwide GHG emissions. We introduce green and red
                colored area, which, similar to the above, should give the audience a sense of
                good and "admissible" emissions. However, instead of using the line described by Northern America
                directly as a delimiter, we add a random offset to the boundary layer between the two areas
                to further elude the sensation that the emissions of both Europe and Northern America are better than
                a certain threshold.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the right plot, the surface temperature increase for Northern America has been smoothed with a
                10-year window rolling average to reduce variance and strengthen the illusion that
                Northern America's average surface temperature change has remained below the average world's level.
                Here, I have purposefully redacted other continents to limit comparability.
                Furthermore, through coloring, the visualization signals to the reader that
                Northern America represents the global minimum, with the rest of the world overshooting the green, i.e.
                "good" area.
            </li>
            <li>
                Concludingly, both visualizations picture a deceptive picture, allowing viewers to oppose the
                proposition and believe that Northern America is not a main contributor to climate change.

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            For the visualizations I have used the <a href="https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/access-data"><em>Quarterly
            Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Air Emissions
            Accounts</em></a> (2010-2023, published March 05, 2024) and <a
                href="https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/access-data"><em>Annual Surface Temperature
            Change</em></a> (1961-2022, published April 03, 2023) datasets published on the IMF Climate Change
            Dashboard. Furthermore, I have used the World Bank's <a
                href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL"><em>Population</em></a> (1961-2022, published
            2022) dataset to
            accomplish the per-capita transformations. The aggregation of these datasets is not straight
            forward due to different naming and indexing conventions between the datasets. Moreover, some datasets
			list indicators by country and others per continent. Thus, I have aggregated all per-country datasets by
			continent and global numbers before creating the above visualizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            I kept my visualizations simple and limited myself to a combination of line and area charts to enshrine
            the trust and credibility the reader can build towards the visualizations. The high data-ink ratio and soberness
            of the visualizations display a thorough understanding, a factual approach to the data, and allow for a
			natural causal
            reasoning with which the reader can argue for or against the proposition. I used smoothing and the
            per-capita "trick" to build my opposing arguments.

			On a global level, Northern America has a relatively small (but
            notable) influence on factors such as GHG emissions and their contribution to surface heat (think parking,
            sealed surfaces, urban dwellings, etc.). However, using per-capita considerations and a
            non-comparative analysis of the surface temperatures, we can make the case that Northern America's
            inhabitants are a major contributor to the climate change we are experiencing.
        </p>
        <p>
            This exercise has truly shown me that visualizations, particularly the intent behind them, can make or
            break an argument. Through obfuscation, styling, and omission, it is possible to build a
            case with clear intent and persuade the reader to change their opinions.
