        <h2>Subtheme: Housing for The Rich</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            We are experiencing a critical housing shortage globally, driven by the commodification of the real estate
            market, the correlated increasing costs of living, and a shortage of affordable housing. Particularly in
            Boston,
            the situation is dire, <b>51%</b> of the population not being able to afford housing with 30% or less
            of their income. As prices are soaring for both renting and acquiring properties, family formation is
            decreasing, pushing both working- and middle-class individuals out of the City
            <a href="#references">[1]</a>. These trends are exacerbated
            by the increasing housing development supply targeting the high-income class with luxury condos
            and apartments in convenient locations. These housing options, however, are mainly used as capital
            investments
            and are often uninhabited <a href="#references">[2]</a>. With the current market conditions and mounting
            pressure, we present an
            exploratory data analysis targeting identifying the trends and correlations mentioned above in data provided
            by the public planning agency Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC). We mainly focus on the evolution
            of residential sales in the City of Boston, considering the period between 2000 and 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below, we present our analysis questions, which are spurred by the provided readings for the sub-theme
            <em>Housing for the Rich</em>. The first question is spurred by reading <a href="#references">[2]</a>, the
            <em>Homes For Profit</em> report indicates that the Boston housing market is making it increasingly
            impossible for families to purchase single-family homes. The second and third questions are, in contrast,
            mainly spurred by reading <a href="#references">[1]</a>, which indicates that downtown real estate is
            increasingly used purely as a
            commodity market or vacancy home. With prices in the double-digit millions, we investigate how ownership
            has evolved and how speculation unfolds over time and space in the wider Boston area.
        </p>

        <h3>The Dataset</h3>
        For the following analysis, we used the <em>Residential sales data in the City of Boston, 2000-2023</em>,
        containing data until the end of 2022. We used the dataset on <em>Single family zoning vs
        other housing zoning in Metro Boston</em> for the GIS component of our analysis. The residential sales data
        includes 63 dimensions of both qualitative and quantitative nature. Here, we mostly work with the sales price
        and the counts of transactions. In total, we consider 49,301 entries of sales transactions in the
        greater Boston area.

        <h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

        <h3>1. Which properties have gained importance since the year 2000?</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Sale_Transaction_Prices_Per_Year.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                Distributions of sale prices grouped by year for all recorded transactions.
                We infer the trend line (dotted red) from the progression over time,
                indicating a stark increase in the average real estate sales prices (here on a logarithmic scale).
                We note transaction prices of 1 USD from 2013 onwards (see annotation), likely indicating errors in the
                data acquisition process. The overall maximum is the sale at 999M USD in 2021, which can be attributed
                to the sale of the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/a2lcb24">Boston Landmark Center</a>
                sold in 2022 for 1.63B USB, indicating that 999M USD is used as
                a ceiling value in the sales dataset.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Price_of_1$.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                A non-exhaustive list of price differences between flips of properties previously sold at 1 USD.
                Price differences here are highly negative, indicating that these properties have previously been
                traded at reflective market prices. Note the repeated property addresses, indicating patterns in
                the erroneous recording of sales prices, which are potentially part of a domain-specific and
                legitimate type of entry. For our analysis, we disregard all property sales below 10,000 USD, allowing
                us to remove any outliers that we cannot attribute, reducing our available data from 49,301 to 49,083.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Amount_of_Sales_by_Style.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                Number of sales by real estate style over time. The top five categories are Row-Middle, Mid-Rise,
                High-Rise, Row-End, and Low-Rise, which, however, reduce in particular and overall sales volume over
                time.
                Condos and Free-Standing objects, while not in the top five, have gained sales volume in recent years.
                All other
                styles have relatively low market shares, with Colonial-styled buildings not being traded in some years.
                Thus, we
                group all categories but the last as style <i>other</i>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3></h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Distribution_of_Building_Built_Years.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                The above distribution of count of sales over year built indicates
                an elevated number of buildings being built during the times of the Great Roman Empire and the birth of
                Christ. Thus, for this dimension analysis, we disregard all values before 1780, which is the closest
                lower bound to the more sensible distribution on the right. However, we do not disregard
                this data in general, as these entries can still provide insightful information in other dimensions.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure id="s_built_year_and_style">
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Nr._of_Sales_per_Building_Built_Year_and_Style.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                Discretizing the above count of sales transactions over building years by the building styles, we find
                that the market between 2000 and 2022 has a strong preference for early 20th-century row houses as
                found in the central area of Boston (see <a href="#spatial_three"><b>FIGURE NR</b></a> and
                <a href="#spatial_four"><b>FIGURE NR</b></a> below). Furthermore, Boston has seen a notable
                building boom around that time and during the late 90s and 2000s. In more recent times, Mid- and
                High-rise buildings have been added to the Boston skyline, representing a significant part of the
                total real estate volume traded.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Distribution_of_Interior_Area.png" alt=""/>
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Distribution_of_Lot_Area.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                [Left] The distribution of interior area shows a stark skew towards zero, indicating that this metric of
                sold objects has not been correctly recorded. Disregarding the zero-valued entries, we see a high
                distribution of small interior areas, potentially indicating studios. Counts become more sparse as the
                interior area increases, peaking at 1M square feet. [Right] Similar to the interior area,
                the real estate lot area is also largely misrepresented, with most values at zero square feet.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Median_Interior_vs_Lot_Area_Per_Year.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                Using the data with the above-mentioned price, year built, and interior/lot size filters, we observe
                that the median living and building space increase. This clear trend indicates that units in the
                Boston area increases in size and, accordingly, in price, favoring capital-intensive buyers over others.
                We note that while the median interior area is larger than the lot area, they do not differ as wide
                greatly as expected, reflecting the high transaction volume of townhouses identified in
                <a href="#s_built_year_and_style">Figure 5</a> above.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>2. How did ownership evolve in the greater Boston area?</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Purchases_by_Investor_Type_per_Year.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                The yearly sales transaction volume by investor type shows a clear prevalence of non-investors in the
                market. Unexpectedly, we do not see a significant increase in investor purchases over time. However, we
                can see overall negative trends (observing the dotted trend lines) in Non-count, Small, and Medium
                Investors, indicating a shift in ownership.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Sales_and_Median_Prices_by_Flip_Term_per_Year.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                In resonance with the above plot, we see that most sales are non-flip. Notably, however, the flip term
                dimensions show clear data quality issues with missing values and a significant, unexpected
                discontinuity in 2010. However, in the past decade, long-term flip horizons have shown a prevalence,
                indicating that investors increasingly hold real estate, potentially without the intention to use it
                as their primary residence or open it to the renting market.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure id="ownership_of_buyers">
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Buyer_Ownership_Per_Year.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                Over time, buyers have increasingly become the owners of the real estate they acquire.
                This can indicate scenarios where the property is being refinanced or where the owner is buying
                an additional share of the property they already partially own. Thus, this plot shows most clearly
                how the market has evolved to discriminate against buyers who are not already real estate owners,
                making objects increasingly inaccessible to working- and middle-class families. However, the low
                number of non-owner buyers in most recent years requires a follow-up with domain experts as this has
                not been investigated by either of the readings <a href="#references">[1,2]</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure id="cash_sales">
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Cash_vs_Non-Cash_Sales_over_Time.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                Finally, we compare the progression of sales transactions and median annual property value
                depending on whether the sale has been completed in cash. As suggested in
                <a href="#references">[2]</a>, cash sales have
                increased while mortgage and other financing options are at a continuous loss. In contrast, property
                values of objects acquired in cash are consistently above those financed differently, further
                indicating an inequality of access to the market for non-capital-intensive individuals.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Spatial Distribution of Real Estate Investment and Speculation?</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="./submission_graphics/Spatial_Distribution_of_Sales_by_Year_2000_-_2022.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>
                We overlay the locations of all real estate traded in sales transactions (blue markers) over the
                MAPC's area of influence (red polygons), i.e., the greater Boston area. The color gradient on the
                markers
                indicates the year of the transaction, with lighter transactions being more recent. Note the recent
                expansion of sales transactions from central Boston into its suburbs and the lack of data in cities
                outside central Boston. This spatial
                representation of the data uncovers erroneous entries in the recorded locations. Points further
                than 20 miles from the city center are often misplaced. Real estate seemingly in Rockport
                (top right of the map) or in front of the coast of Africa (coordinates (0, 0)), controversially are
                annotated with addresses in downtown Boston. While for the analysis above, these entries do not
                represent a limitation. We disregard them for the following spatial analysis while maintaining
                the previously applied filters on the sales price (>10,000 USD).
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

                Geographic distribution of real estate sales transactions. A darker hue indicates higher activity,
                mainly concentrated in downtown Boston. It seems that no data is available for the City of
                Cambridge and Somerville are two highly affluent neighborhoods in the Boston area. The data shows
                transactions in the previously Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) neighborhoods in South
                Boston.

                This animation illustrates the temporal progression of sales transactions, differencing between investor
                (orange) and non-investor (orange) buyers, indicating the price through marker size. Note the smaller
                per-unit prices in the early 2000s, as well as the spatial concentration in the inner districts of
                Boston. As time progresses, sales prices increase with pattern-breaking lows in 2007-2009 during the
                Great Recession. Row houses, indicated by relatively small and evenly distributed markers in the Alston
                and Back Bay neighborhoods, have been constantly traded throughout the study period but shifted from
                mainly non-investor-owned to a heterogeneous mixed ownership.

                This map reflects the sales transactions in the animation above but overlays the temporal progression
                in the form of the marker hue. This overlay shows how prices have progressed, highlighting
                key attractors to be sold at increasing prices. Furthermore, we can even more strongly identify the
                preference for row houses in central Boston. Finally, as expected, capital-intensive objects are
                spatially
                concentrated in Downtown and the Seaport district.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            In this analysis, we have explored the data on residential sales transactions kindly offered by MPAC. We
            find that several data quality issues that we have addressed by applying filters on price, building interior
            and lot sizes, year built, and geographic information, depending on the analysis made. We were able to
            conclude with the following findings to our initial analysis questions:
        </p>
        <strong>Which properties have gained importance since the year 2000?</strong>
        <p>
            After our initial data cleaning, we found that row-house and mid-, high-, and low-rise buildings
            dominate the market. Here, high-rise buildings have been in a renaissance since 2017. Furthermore, the data
            shows
            how early 20th-century row houses and Mid-Rise buildings present the main targets of the market. High-Rise
            buildings, in contrast, are mostly built in the late 20th century. Furthermore, we find that the size of
            these
            houses does matter, with both interior living and lot areas steadily increasing since 2000.
        </p>
        <strong>How did ownership evolve in the greater Boston area?</strong>
        <p>
            Ownership is critical in both the real estate acquisition and rental markets. As suggested by
            <a href="#references">[1]</a>, as ownership increasingly moves towards investors and capital-intensive
            individuals, affordable housing stock enters extreme scarcity, putting high pressure on working- and middle-
            class families. Our analysis shows that non-investor purchases are reducing while large and institutional
            investors gain traction in the current market. Worsening the situation is the prevalent long-term horizon
            of flips, reflecting the modification of real estate as a long-term investment. The most preoccupying aspect
            of our analysis is the ownership status of buyers. In <a href="#ownership_of_buyers">Figure 10</a>, we see
            how, over two decades, buyers of new property are owners of said property, indicating that
            access to the market is increasingly granted to landlords rather than newcomers. Finally, this trend is
            reflected also in <a href="#cash_sales">Figure 11</a>. Here, we show how non-cash purchases are slowly
            becoming au-pair with cash purchases while the latter already dominate the market in terms of median annual
            property value. Thus, those with capital can buy easily, often at a great discount, as suggested in
            <a href="#references">[2]</a>.
        </p>
        <strong>What is the spatial distribution of real estate investment and speculation?</strong>
        <p>
            Ultimately, we explore the spatio-temporal component of our data. After disregarding data outside the
            inner Boston area, we find that buyers are venturing into new neighborhoods, targeting exclusive suburbs as
            suggested by <a href="#references">[2]</a>. Furthermore, we find that Row-Houses in Alston and Back Bay
            have been in constant demand, even during the Great Recession. Investors and non-investors are increasingly
            heterogeneously mixed, although the latter dominated the market in the early 2000s. Finally, we find
            the greatest capital accumulation in the Boston Downtown and the Seaport neighborhood.
