        <h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

            Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Aging is a fact that we are confronted with every day. The time is ticking, and, ever so slowly, we
                experience how our precious time is fading. I wanted to explore how the U.S. population's age group
                distribution differs between 1900 and 2000. I also wanted to see whether the two sexes behaved
                equally or if there were major shifts in their distributions. Through the hourglass, the audience
                immediately perceives how our past trickles into the present. I find it impressive how such a simple
                artifact affords such a deep emotional response, at least for myself, when combined with data on age.
                What is imminent is the bottleneck in the middle - only a few of us will reach the very top, bidding
                farewell to most of us as we fade into the eternity of time.
            </li>
            <li>
                The difference in size between the two pyramids is immediately perceivable, as well as the skew of the
                2000s pyramid towards the female sex. Furthermore, it is evident that the population as a whole has
                increased significantly, but we have also become older on average. While qualitative
                differentiation is effortless and afforded through scale and inversion, drawing numerical information
                from the graphic is hard. There is no simple way to understand just how big the difference in population
                between the sexes per age group is. Similarly, the quantitative comparison between the two observed
                years is difficult.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the next sketch, I would want to compare the change in age distribution more closely, making it
                easier for the audience to confront the age group and sex between those two years and understand their
                evolution. I will stick to my initial question and alter the approach to the design instead
                of the scope.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <figure>
            <img src="./media/sketch_2.png" alt=""/>
            <figcaption>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Here, the data is given more room, while interpretation leads to a cognitive rather than affective
                learning objective. The audience can easily understand how the percentual distribution of the male and
                female population shifts between 1900 and 2000. The discretization between the sexes is easy, given
                the spatial subdivision in the center and the male/female icons, distinguishing one side of
                the graphic from the other. The symmetry between the two sides, furthermore, allows an accessible
                comparison.
            </li>
            <li>
                The low data-to-ink ratio and the high cognitive bias bother me in this design, removing the
                affective intent that I expressed in my first sketch. However, it is clearer how the population became,
                on average, older over the past century. Furthermore, it is also simpler to compare the two observed
                years and the sexes. Nevertheless, similar to the plot above, it is difficult for the viewer to gain
                numerical insight into the data. How much is the change? What is the scale of the percentages? Bigger
                means more, but how much more needs to be clarified. Furthermore, coloring the different areas for
                the age groups ranging from 0 to 90 can be confusing. My available colors needed to be nicely ordered
                to decrease the darkness of color, which would have been more intuitive in this visualization.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the next sketch, I will focus again on the population sizes rather than the percentual change
                of age groups by sex. While the latter might have a stronger descriptive power of the question posed,
                the former allows the reader a more intuitive comparison through size and shape without having to
                venture into the domain of percentages and their relation to total population sizes. I will also
                be more consistent with using color and numerical labeling.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <figure>
            <img src="./media/sketch_3.png"

            <figcaption>

        </figure>

        <p>
            Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                With this sketch, I wanted to depart from the classical visualization of populations, i.e., the
                pyramid that the audience knows, and express age progression with the analogy of topology and
                climbing a mountain. The bigger the plateau, i.e., the area between the contour lines dependent on the
                size of the population's group size, the more people are resting there. Again, we understand
                that aging is like climbing a mountain, and while more people managed to climb the mountain in 2000, it was
                still only a small percentage of the population. On the note of total population size, the viewer
                can immediately sense the different sizes of the two mountains and the proportion between them. The
                circles represent the population size in a specific age group.
            </li>
            <li>
                Again, this illustration is founded in a more artistic than quantitative dimension. I enjoy looking
                at a topology map and immediately obtaining an intuition on the size and relation of and between
                the populations. The title seems like a river between the two mountains, and the legend is
                positioned in accordance to real geographic maps. Similar to some illustrations in lectures, I have used
                the bubble size as an indicator for the population size of an age group. However, the relation between
                size and number is difficult to grasp since the size is continuous, while the legend shows
                three discrete sizes. Finally, adding the absolute population numbers for the two years would have
                been good for providing an improved sense of quantity.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>
            The three sketches explore related but different approaches to answer our question on how the U.S.
            Population age and gender compositions differ between 1900 and 2000. While sketches one and three focus on the
            absolute amount of the population per age group and sex, sketch two goes further and affords the viewer to
            understand percentual relations between 1900 and 2000. All three sketches miss a more quantitative dimension
            due to a purposeful omission of values or a poor visualization of said values on the axis.

            However, coming from a computer science background, I enjoyed exploring the more qualitative and affective
            aspects of data visualizations. I want to feel how population sizes differ between groups and years.
            I want to feel that aging is hard and only a few reach the current <em>top</em> of 90+ years.
            This was best described in sketches one and three; thus, I will proceed with those. Of those two, I enjoyed
            the time glass the most as it alludes to the audience to the progression of time at the moment, i.e., age,
            and over longer periods, i.e., centuries.

        <h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

            <figcaption>
                U.S. population distribution pyramids for years 2000 (bottom) and 1900 (inverted, top), discretized
                by sex and age group (10-year binning). An hourglass, in which the two pyramids are inscribed, affords
                the understanding of the differente in time between 1900 and 2000 while representing the relative
                total population sizes. On the side, each half of the hourglass is illustrated separately, with the
                total number of male and female populations attributed to them.

        </figure>

    <section>
        <h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

        <p>
            Starting from the initial sketches, I took the mirrored pyramids and hourglass as a base. I revisited
            the scale and determined that it is easier to consider the population in millions rather than thousands (it
            is difficult to envision a thousand thousand). Furthermore, looking at sketch two, I
            want to avoid venturing further into the quantitative domain and purposefully stick to the qualitative one.
            However, I combined my concepts from sketches one and two, i.e., mentioning the overall population sizes and
            using both numbers and bubble sizes to indicate the composition of the population. I used the affordance of
            the funnel to indicate that the male and female sexes compose the central mirrored pyramid chart.
            Finally, I thought of using the hourglass halves in the same proportional sizes as they are in the main
            hourglass to allow the audience to feel the size difference without any other data interfering with that
            aspect.
        </p>


        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>
            How did U.S. population age and gender compositions differ between 1900 and 2000? From the exploratory illustration
            above, the audience can get a good initial idea of how to answer this question. The population has become bigger overall
            and is becoming older on average, and women fare better than men. High age has become something many can strive towards,
            but just as in the past, it is hard to attain. A viewer could infer, that the past century has been free of major,
            species-threatening events and a time of economic and potentially welfare upturn. Nevertheless, I have but scraped
            the surface. With the data provided, but particularly with more data and knowledge from the U.S. Census Bureau,
            it would be possible to pencil in the missing gaps such as the development of numbers in terms of different demographics,
            the distribution of wealth, and how it impacted the different age groups. More information could also give us
            insights into our data's inherent uncertainty.

            Concludingly, the final graphic conveys exactly the affective objective that has evolved over the sketching and
            iteration phase: Age, time, and life, in a wider sense, is something valuable, something that is running out
            at all times, for each of us. It did so in 1900, so it does in 2000, so it does in this very instant. When
            looking at population, each one of us contributes to the numbers, and together, we represent the
            steady flow of passing from belonging to 0-10 to 90-100. I wanted a qualitative rather than a quantitative
            experience. Something where the audience needs a second to understand, grasp, and absorb the magnitudes,
            the differences, and the composition of the statistics.
